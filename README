This tool is based on Buildroot.  

To build the sdk, do the following

Clone the repo:
git@10.1.30.30:Lalith/sdk.git

Pick the minimal configuration. This will build quickly with the just the necessary tools / libs :

cd sdk
make sdk-minimal_defconfig

kick off the build :
make sdk

<have a cup of tea>

When done, the sdk will be in output/images/sdk-xxxxxx.tar.gz
(the xxxxxxx is the sdk repo git commit version)

expand the tar file to your $(HOME), which will create a $(HOME)/sdk directory

The rest of the builds (kernel, uboot, buildroot) refer to this $(HOME)/sdk to ensure consitancy

Have fun
