This tool is based on Buildroot.  

To build the sdk, do the following

Clone the repo:
git@github.com/Access-IS/sdk.git

Pick the minimal configuration. This will build quickly with the just the necessary tools / libs :

cd sdk
make sdk-minimal_defconfig

create /opt/sdk, change permissions:
sudo mkdir /opt/sdk
sudo chown <user>.<group> /opt/sdk

kick off the build :
make sdk

<have a cup of tea>

When done, the sdk will be in output/images/sdk-xxxxxx.tar.gz
(the xxxxxxx is the sdk repo git commit version)

as root, expand the tar file to /opt/ , which will create an /opt/sdk directory

as normal user do a  source /opt/sdk/env.sh to add sdk binary path, sysroot and other environment variables 

The rest of the builds (kernel, uboot, buildroot) refer to this /opt/sdk to ensure consitancy

Have fun
